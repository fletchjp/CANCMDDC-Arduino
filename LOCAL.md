# Local changes

This is a fork of the CANCMDDC-Arduino project which is on MERG-DEV.

I am keeping a copy of this here for reference and will put my own changes (if any) into this local branch.

This program uses CBUS only to communicate with the cabs. I set out in 2019 to make a version which would work fully with CBUS and called that CANCMDDC2. As this one does not work with FCU my version is going to be called CAMCMDDC and not CANCMDDC2. That is going to be very confusing unless I am very careful.

I am going to create another repository called CANCMDDC2 alongside this one. It will have inside it a program called CANCMDDC which will be the basis of what gets shared. I need to build that from the various versions which I have been working on for the last 18 months or so.
